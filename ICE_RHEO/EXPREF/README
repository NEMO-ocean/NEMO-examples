purpose
-------
This demonstration case allows for examining the sea ice rheology under idealised
forcing.  The set-up follows the paper "Stress and deformation characteristics of sea
ice in a high-resolution, anisotropic sea ice model" by Heorton et al, Phil. Trans,
R. Soc. 2018.

-----------
Experiments
-----------
A range of experiments can be configured:

- The suggested experiment is to examine the different shear patterns formed
  by different rheologies. The default set-up reproduces the leftmost panels
  of figure 3a (ln_rhg_EAP true in namelist_ice_cfg) and 3b (ln_rhg_EVP true in
  namelist_ice_cfg). Increase the last time step in namelist_cfg appropriately
  to generate the other panels.

- The resolution of the box can be changed analogous to figure 2 of the paper
  (change rn_dx and rn_dy in namelist_cfg, default is 2000m)

- The ratio of the windstress component can be changed to cause different modes 
  of failure (Rwind in usrdef_sbc.F90, default is -0.8) 

It takes about 10 minutes to run a simulation on 16 processors

----------
How to run
----------

a) Compile and run the model once to get mesh_mask_xxxx.nc files.
   E.g., starting in the root NEMO directory:

 ./makenemo -a ICE_RHEO -r ICE_RHEO_TEST -m X64_MOBILIS -j 4
 cd tests/ICE_RHEO_TEST/EXP00
 mpirun -np 1 ./nemo

c) Create the initial condition file for sea-ice (initice.nc) by running
   this python script:

 python ../../ICE_RHEO/EXPREF/make_INITICE.py

d) Run the model a second time

 mpirun -np 16 ./nemo

---------------
What to look at
---------------
EVP rheology has less defined shear strain maxima (linear kinematic
features). If the model is run longer one can see that the LKFs appearing
with EVP rheology intersect at a different angle than with EAP rheology
